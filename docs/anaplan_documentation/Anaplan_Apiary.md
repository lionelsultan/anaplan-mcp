API use requirements
As a best practice for using our APIs, you should be familiar with RESTful APIs, command-line interfaces such as cURL, and exploratory API tools similar to Postman. Each endpoint in this document is described with its required request header and body elements, which enables users to carry out the call.
What can I do with the API?
You can use the Anaplan RESTful API to carry out these actions:
To carry out an import:
You must have a file to be imported to Anaplan and know where it is in the file system.
You must know the workspace ID and model ID of your Import definition.
Getting Started
This section contains general information to help you start using the Anaplan API.
Implementation considerations
When integrating with our API, clients must not assume the response fields are fixed and should write their parsers to gracefully ignore unknown or extra fields.
Authentication
Note: If your workspace uses single sign-on (SSO), your user must be assigned as an Exception User to use basic authentication and obtain an Anaplan authentication token.  For more information on exception users in Anaplan, see  Assign Exception Users in Anapedia.
To use this API, you must send requests using an Anaplan authentication token. This is in the form of a JSON Web Token. This must be in the Authorization header of the API request. For example: Authorization:AnaplanAuthToken {anaplan_auth_token} Where {anaplan_auth_token} is replaced with your authentication token. For more information, see Authentication Service API
Data encryption
All Anaplan API communication happens over HTTPS with 2048-bit certificates, which provides for data encryption in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3. TLS 1.2 is still supported.
TLS support in integration clients
When you build integrations with Anaplan APIs, ensure your integrations are built to use TLS 1.3. Anaplan APIs do not support TLS 1.1.
Definitions
Dimension
A dimension is a data item, measure, or characteristic that you can calculate or manipulate. Dimensions enable you to answer business questions, observe trends, or assess What If situations for planning purposes.
List
Lists are groups of related items, such as people in a department, products on a shopping list, or the regions comprising a geographic area. They are fundamental to Anaplan as they define the structure and content of a model.
Lists are a type of dimension.
HTTP Verbs
To carry out actions using the Anaplan API, you can use these HTTPS verbs.
cURL Examples
This API Reference includes cURL examples and responses.
If you want to ensure that the response to a curl request includes the HTTP request headers, include the optional verbose flag -v or --verbose.
To view an example cURL request and server response:
Click an item in the Reference section of the navigation pane on the left.
Click a colored textbox in the middle pane.
In the example that appears, select cURL from the drop-down nearest the Try button.
Note: Anaplan has not set up a live server for use through this Apiary website. If you have credentials, you can use the examples in this help system as a guide when sending requests to the server that Anaplan has provided.
HTTP responses
Anaplan APIs return HTTP responses in the 2XX, 4XX, and 5XX categories.
2XX responses indicate a success with the API call.
4XX responses indicate an issue with the request.  Check for mandatory request parameters. Then check the request parameters and body contain the appropriate values and types. There should be an error message in the response body to help diagnose the error.
429 responses can result from rate limiting or concurrent request limiting on some API calls. If you receive a 429 response, wait for a brief period and retry.
The table below displays the expected HTTP responses for Anaplan’s APIs.
Chaining Parameters
Many endpoint paths contain a chain of parameters that you can build step-by-step. For example, to get the status of an import task, you might use something like this: /workspaces/{workspaceID}/models/{modelID}/imports/{importID}/tasks/{taskId}
In this example, you need to make this sequence of calls to get the Ids required to get the status of the import task:
Log into Anaplan and click the ? for help.  Select About from the drop-down list.
From the About window, copy the Workspace Id and Model Id values.
Manually enter the workspaceID to use.
Manually enter the modelID to use.
GET the list of imports in the model.
Choose an importID from the list of imports.
POST the tasks for the import. This returns a taskID.
GET the status of the taskID for the import.
Note: If you already know some of the required Ids, you can skip those calls and only make calls for the Ids that you do not already know.
API behavior when the model is busy
Due to ongoing model actions, automation, or even maintenance, your API call may behave differently, depending on whether the model is busy. The following actions will return information, even if the model is busy:
All other endpoints will wait for the model to be available again, before completing their run.
API rate limitation
To make our API service more robust and resilient, there is a flat 600-requests-per-minute rate limit. That’s equivalent to 10 requests per second (RPS). Rate limiting helps us protect our API service and platform from attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) and other malicious actions. This practice improves resource utilization and raises quality of service for all our customers.
How does rate limitation work?
The rate limit algorithm is based on a token bucket algorithm. This allows us to plan for a long-term number of customer requests, while permitting intermittent bursts of activity.
The algorithm works as follows:
A token is added to the bucket every 60 seconds / 600 requests = 0.1 seconds
When there are 600 tokens in the bucket, no more are added.
Each request removes a token from the bucket.
When the bucket is empty, requests are denied.
The rate limit applies at the tenant level, so all workspaces in a single tenant share the same limit.
If your integration hits the RPS limit, you get a 429 Too Many Requests error message. Once you reach the limit, you will need to wait for a period of time for a token to be added to the bucket — this time is returned in the Retry-After header of the 429 response.
In case of a 429 error, we recommend that you hardcode a 10 second timeout into your integration. If you have difficulties to stay within the rate limit, reach out to Anaplan Support.
Formats
Anaplan supports only application/json format for API requests and responses, but a file chunk is returned as a stream of binary data in the application/octet-stream format.
Headers
Anaplan APIs only support the indicated headers for each endpoint.
Pagination
If your API calls return a lot of data, you can specify that results are returned in pages. You can specify:
A limit for the number of results to return per page.
An offset to get a specific page of results starting from a particular result.
An attribute on which to sort the results.
Note: Paging specifies the number of results returned by an API request in pages. This is not the number of pages in a file.
See Display pages of results.
Parameter Types
These parameter types form the basis of calls you make with the Anaplan Integration API V2. Path parameters must follow their equivalent parameter without an ID. Typically, you can retrieve the strings or numbers used as parameters through other calls.
The parameters you can use to return information, such as about a workspace or model, apply to the authenticated user's default tenant.
Note: All path parameters with a type of string are case sensitive. This means workspace Ids must be input in lowercase, for example 8a8b8c8d8e8f8g8i, and model Ids must be input in uppercase, for example 75A40874E6B64FA3AE0743278996850F, otherwise the object will not be recognized.
Query parameters
Certain endpoints have query parameters that change the response. The detailed effects of these query parameters are explained in the documentation for each endpoint. The capitalization of each query parameter must match the table below.
Post runtime parameters to a process or an import
You can pass parameters to a process or an import when you POST it.
Note: You must include a locale when specifying parameters.
For example, you can specify:
Mapping parameters. For instance, you can specify the Anaplan Version dimension to which data is to be imported. See Run import process with mapping data and Import with mapping data
The locale for which the information is intended. For instance, you might want the decimal separator to be shown as a comma for certain locales.
Permission to run actions
Unless you're a workspace administrator, your assigned Model Role must grant you access to the action you want to run using the API. Workspace administrators can run any action regardless of their assigned role. API requests without Workspace Administator role or permissions, may result in errors or unexpected results.
Private and Default Files for Bulk APIs
Private files are created when you use the Anaplan API to:
Upload a file.
Run the file export action.
Private files have these characteristics:
A private import file can only be accessed by the user who originally uploaded the source file to the model.
A private export file can only be accessed by the user who originally ran the export.
Private files are stored in models and removed if not accessed at least once in 48 hours. If your private file no longer exists for a file Import Data Source or file Export Action, the default file is used instead.
Default files are used when a private file does not exist for a file import data source or export action. Default files can be set for Admins only or Everyone.
Note: Default files can only be set and modified using the Anaplan user interface.
Your workspace role determines whether you can access a default file that is set to be available to Admins only. If you do not have access, a '404 not found' error occurs.
If a default file is set for Admins only, only workspace administrators can download the default file. A '404 not found' error occurs for other API users (end users).
If a default file is set for Everyone, all users (including end users) in your Anaplan environment (tenant) can download the default file.
If a private file was created during an import or export action that you carried out, you receive that file instead of the default one.
See the Overview of Private and Default Files for more information.

Bulk delete models
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/bulkDeleteModels
Use this call to delete one or more models in a workspace. The models must be closed before they can be deleted. Failure to delete one of the models for some reason, for example the calling user not having access to that model, will not affect the deletion of the rest of the specified models.
Notes:
The user must be a workspace administrator in the specified workspace and have access to the specified models.
This is a destructive action - be careful when deleting models.

Error responses
Check model status
2/0/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/status
Certain actions such as imports, exports, or writeback actions require exclusive access to a model during their execution. These actions lock the model. Any attempt to read information via the API is blocked as they require an exclusive transaction to run. This endpoint provides a status for the model.

From the above responses, the currentStep property returns the status of the model under different scenarios -
Open - When no process is running on the model.
Processing - When import/export task is being processed on the model.
Updating - When any update is being performed on the model, eg. cell write.
Closed - When model is in maintenance state.
The tooltip returns details about the transaction being performed on the model and the user information who initiated the transaction along-with the progress information.

Close model
/close
This endpoint enables a workspace administrator to close a model without having to wait for a timeout. This is particularly useful for root cause analysis when an error occurs.
To use this endpoint, you must supply a valid authentication and the model id.
Request
curl -X POST \
https://api.anaplan.com/2/0/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/close \
-H 'Authorization: AnaplanAuthToken {anaplan_auth_token}'
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
Headers
Parameters
Response
Response 200
A successful close action will provide a 200 OK response.
Response 204
A successful close action will provide a 200 No content response.
Response 401
An unsuccessful close action will provide a 401 Unauthorized response if a valid authentication token was not provided.
Response 403
An unsuccessful close action will provide a 403 Forbidden response if your user authentication lacks workspace administrator permissions.
Response 404
An unsuccessful close action will provide a 404 Not found response if the {modelId} or {workspaceId} is not found.
Response 422
An unsuccessful close action will provide a 422 Unprocessable identity response if the model is currently in a state that cannot process the action, for example, if the model is archived.

Wake up a model
/workspaces/{workspaceID}/models/{modelID}/open
Use this request to wake up a model (either upgrading from metadata-only, or opening from closed). As some very large models have long load times, you can build this into your automations to have them fully load before your model builders start working on them.
Note: To wake up a model, you must have Workspace Administrator authority in the model.

Fair use policy
This API endpoint is designed to support standard, day-to-day operations of your Anaplan users. Excessive or abnormal usage patterns that negatively impact system performance or stability are strictly prohibited. Examples of prohibited activity include (but are not limited to):
Repeated requests to open models that are already open as a means of maintaining a "keep-alive", when unaccessed models time out and offload after 60 minutes.
Requests designed to open or query a large number of models simultaneously or otherwise place excessive load on backend infrastructure.
Repeated requests to open models that are already open as a means of artificially maintaining their loaded state. For performance and security purposes, Anaplan monitors model usage and offloads unaccessed models after a period of inactivity.

Retrieve all items in a dimension
/models/{modelGuid}/dimensions/{dimensionId}/items
Use this call to retrieve the IDs, codes, and names for items in a specified dimension. The dimension must be a list, a list subset, a line item subset, or the Users dimension.
Calls at model-level do not support the Time dimension. The calls return a 400 response. To avoid this, use the view dimension instead.
Notes:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
This call is on the model-level. It returns all dimension items as it does not have view-level hiding, filtering, or Selective Access. For the view-level endpoint, see Retrieve selected items in a dimension.
If codes have not been set for an item, then the response excludes the code field.
This call only supports the retrieval of dimensions and items from a dimension that contains a maximum of 1,000,000 items.
The call returns a 400 response for any more than that number of items.

Retrieve selected items in a dimension
/models/{modelId}/views/{viewId}/dimensions/{dimensionId}/items
Use this call to retrieve selected IDs, codes, and names for items in a specified dimension. This call returns data as filtered by the page builder when they configure the view. This call respects hidden items, filtering selections, and Selective Access. If the view contains hidden or filtered items, these do not display in the response.
Notes:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator
This call works with any dimension type
The items in the response may not be ordered
The response returns Items within a flat list (no hierarchy)
This is a view-level call. For the model-level call, see Retrieve all data for items in a dimension
This call only supports the retrieval of dimension items within a view that contains a maximum of 1,000,000 cells. If the specified view contains more than 1,000,000 dimension items, then the call returns a 400 Bad Request HTTP status, instead of a subset of the dimension items. Use the quick sum bar in Anaplan to identify the number of dimension items in a view
The viewId in this request can also be replaced by any valid lineItemId. If the Line Item has a changed dimensionality (has a Subsidiary View), the response returns the applicable dimension items for the given dimension. Otherwise, the response returns all default applicable dimension items for the given dimension

Retrieve metadata for dimensions on a view
/models/{modelId}/views/{viewId}
Use this call to retrieve the name, IDs, and lists of names for the dimensions (columns, pages, rows) on a specified view.
Notes:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator
If a view has no dimensions on an axis, the call omits the axis field (for example, no “rows” field at all instead of “rows”: [])
If a view is the default view, its name is set to be the same as the module name
The viewId in this request can also be replaced by any valid lineItemId. If the Line Item has a changed dimensionality (has a Subsidiary View), the response returns the metadata applicable to that line item. Otherwise, the response returns the default metadata
You can use this API call to map dimensions to cell data export headers or transform grid CSV format to tabular single column format.

Retrieve cell data for a view
Use this call to retrieve the cell data for a view. You can either query for the default page, or provide page selectors to query for other pages. This call returns data in either a CSV grid response or as JSON.
Notes:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
This call only supports the retrieval of cells from a view that contains a maximum of 1,000,000 cells. If the specified view contains more than 1,000,000 cells, then the call returns a 400 Bad Request HTTP status, instead of a subset of the cells. Use the quick sum bar in Anaplan to identify the number of cells in a view.
If you call several times in a short amount of time, you may receive a 429 response.
You can replace the viewId with any valid lineItemId. If the line item has a subsidiary view, the response returns the data as seen in that subsidiary view.
For line items without a subsidiary view, the response returns data for the default view of the line item.
CSV responses
The first line of the CSV response contains the values of the page selectors. The response omits this line when there are no dimensions on pages. When there are multiple dimensions on columns, a line for each dimension follows the first line that contains the values of the page selectors. When there are multiple dimensions on rows, a column displays on the left, before the data, for each dimension on rows. You can export the CSV data in different layouts by passing two query parameters exportType and moduleId together.
JSON responses
To receive a JSON-formatted response instead of a CSV-formatted response:
Pass an Accept header of application/json.
Pass a query parameter of format set to v1.
All other parameters are the same as a CSV-formatted response.
The response returns Content-Type application/json with this format:
A pages key with a value that is a list of the selected items for each page selector. If no page selectors exist for this view, the list displays as empty or absent.
A columnCoordinates key with a value that is a list of the coordinates for all values in that column. Each list item is itself a list containing one or more values. The length of each list equals the number of dimensions on columns.
A rows key with a value that is a list of row objects. Each row object contains:
A rowCoordinates key with a value that is a list of the coordinates for all values in the current row. Each list item is itself a list that contains one or more values. The length of each list equals the number of dimensions on rows.
A cells key with a value, which is a list of all the cell values in the current row. To get the full coordinates for each cell, use the position of the cell value in the cells list, and find the column coordinates at the same position in the columnCoordinates list. Then, to uniquely specify the cell, combine the column coordinates with the rowCoordinates for the current row and any selected pages.

Retrieve dimension items for a line item
/models/{modelId}/lineItems/{lineItemId}/dimensions/{dimensionId}/items
Use this call to retrieve IDs, codes, and names for dimension items that apply for the specified line item.
Notes:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
This call works with any dimension type.
Your requesting model role must allow read access to the module the line item belongs to. Otherwise, this call returns a 404 Not Found HTTP status.
The items in the response are ordered as listed in the Anaplan model.
The response returns items within a flat list (no hierarchy).
This returns dimension items that apply to a line item. For the view-level call, see Retrieve selected items in a dimension and for the model-level call, see Retrieve all items in a dimension.
This call only supports the retrieval of dimension items where the dimension contains a maximum of 1,000,000 items. If the specified dimension contains more than 1,000,000 dimension items, then the call returns a 400 Bad Request HTTP status, instead of a subset of the dimension items.
Providing a non-existent Line Item ID or Dimension ID returns a 404 Not Found HTTP status.
If the request provides an invalid line item ID or dimension ID this call returns a 400 Bad Request HTTP status.

Response scenarios

When requestState is COMPLETE and successful is true , the export has completed successfully and the user can download all the pages.
When requestState is COMPLETE and successful is false, this means the export failed. Retry and initiate a new export.
When requestState is IN_PROGRESS the export has not yet completed, but you can download the available pages indicated by the availablePages field.
When requestState is NOT_STARTED then simply check the status again.
When requestState is CANCELLED then this request is completed by a 'DELETE' call.
We recommend you delete the last failed export before initiating a new export, using the delete export endpoint.

Download pages
Use this call to download the available pages, either when the read request is in progress, or when the request is completed. This request returns a CSV format response of the export list items.
You can download pages while the export is in progress. You can download up to availablePages number of pages returned by the export status API.
Note that page numbers start with zero. That means if 10 pages are available, you can download from page=0 through page=9
Note:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
As a best practice, use the Delete read requests call to clear all pages from completed exports as soon as you download all pages. Doing so will make space available for future exports.

Delete read requests
Use this call to delete or cancel an initiated read request. This removes all the pages from the file store and stops the ongoing read request.
Notes:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
As a best practice, use this call to clear all pages from completed exports as soon as you download all pages. Doing so will make space available for future exports.
An expiration timer starts after the read request is initiated, with the following conditions:
30 minutes after no activity is recorded for that read request, the system will reclaim that space.
The expiration timer resets back to 30 minutes if the requested page number is divisible by 100, including page 0.

Update module cell data

View the following endpoints for further details on lists APIs:
Write cell data to module by coordinate or name

Note: When an update to cell data completes successfully, all downstream calculations are also complete. This includes cells linked by formulas to the cells being updated.
Write cell data by coordinate or name
/models/{modelId}/modules/{moduleId}/data
Use this call to set cell values in a module.
Ensure the request body is an array of CellWrite objects. Each object is for an updated individual cell and its full set of dimensions.
The response contains a summary of the number of cells updated successfully and the details of why some cells that could not be updated.
Notes:
Ensure the user has write access enabled.
Ensure the request includes all of the required fields.
Ensure the request has a value field that is either a string, number or boolean and is compatible with the line item format/data type.
If one cell cannot update, the other cells in the request still continue to update.
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
Workspace administrators can import data into any cell (except aggregate cells, see below), including read-only and invisible cells.
You can update a maximum of 100,000 cells or 15 MB of data (whichever is lower), in a single API call. For larger scale payloads, we recommend you use the import API.
Write cell data does not apply to aggregate cells.
An aggregate cell is a cell where one of its dimension items has it’s own child items
This includes aggregate cells for line Items with breakback enabled
For a line Item that is dimensioned by a composite list, the only writeable cells are the child items, that are defined directly in the dimension list and not defined in a parent list.

Logic for add items
The add list items behavior uses specific logic with names and codes. This logic varies between general lists and numbered lists in Anaplan.
Add items to a general list
Add items to a numbered list
For a numbered list, the name column is used for the index. The name is automatically generated. When you add an item, the API does not allow a name as an input.
Response 200 Body
The response body contains a JSON object that contains total (total number of items in request), ignored (number of items ignored), added (number of items added), and failures (a description of the reason of each failure) fields. In the failures response, each field contains failures information about any errors encountered while performing the add action. requestIndex is the index in input items array.

"schema": "https://anaplan.api.com/2/0/objects/item"

"status": {
"code": 200,
"message": "Success"

"ignored": 1,
"total": 2,
"failures": [
{
"requestIndex": 1,
"failureType": "INCORRECT_FORMAT",
"failureMessageDetails": "incorrect format -- column name:p-number, value:wrong value for number"
}
]
}

Update list items
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/lists/{listId}/items
Use this call to update items to a list. You must provide the model ID and list ID on the request URL. There are two kinds of lists in Anaplan: standard list and numbered list. For a standard list, the API identifies the item using the id, code, or name. For numbered list, the API uses the id or code. If property or subset is not specified in the input, the existing value is not updated. You can update one or more items in each request.
When you specify the list item identifier, select one of the appropriate identifiers (id, code, or name). If the request contains multiple identifiers, the API returns an error.
Notes:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
A maximum of 100,000 list items can be updated with a single call.
The update list items allows updates or lists and numbered Lists.
Note: When an update to a list item completes successfully, all downstream calculations are also complete. This includes cells linked by formulas to the cells being updated.

Response 200 body
The response body contains a JSON object that contains total (total number of items in request), updated (number of items updated), ignored (number of items ignored), and failures fields. On failures, each field contains information about any errors encountered while performing the update action. requestIndex is the index in the input items array.

Delete list items
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/lists/{listId}/items?action=delete
Use this call to delete items from a list. You must provide the list ID or Code to identify each list item. You can delete one or more list items in one API call by providing different identifiers for each item. For example, provide the ID for one item and code for another.
Notes:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
A maximum of 100,000 list items can be deleted with a single call.

Download pages
Use this call to download the available pages, either when the read request is in progress, or when the request is completed. This request returns a CSV format response of the export list items.
You can download pages while the export is in progress. You can download up to availablePages number of pages returned by the export status API. Note that page numbers start with zero. That means if 10 pages are available, you can download from page=0 through page=9
Note: To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.

Delete read requests
Use this call to delete or cancel an initiated read request. This removes all the pages from the file store and stops the ongoing read request.
Note:
To use this call, you must be a Workspace Administrator.
As a best practice, use this call to clear all pages from completed exports as soon as you download all pages. Doing so will make space available for future exports.
An expiration timer starts after the read request is initiated, with the following conditions:
30 minutes after no activity is recorded for that read request, the system will reclaim that space.
The expiration timer resets back to 30 minutes if the requested page number is divisible by 100, including page 0.

Set current period
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/currentPeriod
Use this call to change or reset the current period in Anaplan. When this call contains a specified date (for example, 2020-05-20), the API determines what period range contains the specified data and sets that range as the current period.  When the date value is set to blank in this call, the API resets the current period to blank.
Warning: A change to your time settings is a potentially destructive action and may lead to data loss.  The new range of time periods may not include previous time periods. Any data in the removed time periods is deleted from the model.

Upload Files for Actions

View the following endpoints for further details on upload files for actions APIs:
Get the ID and information for the model file to upload
Set the chunk count
Upload file as a single chunk
Upload a file in chunks
Complete the upload

You can either upload a file as a single chunk, or in several chunks. We recommend that you upload files in several chunks. This enables you to resume an upload that fails before the final chunk is uploaded. In addition, you can compress files on the upload action. We recommend compressing single chunks that are larger than 50 MB. This creates a Private File.
Note: To upload a file using the API that file must exist in Anaplan. If the file has not been previously uploaded, you must upload it initially using the Anaplan user interface. You can then carry out subsequent uploads of that file using the API.
To upload a file:
Set the chunk count.
Upload the file as a single chunk or in several chunks.
Important: When uploading a file and the default file is set for Admins only or Everyone, you MUST Set the chunk count BEFORE uploading it.
Get the ID and information for the model file to upload
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/files
To upload a file, you need its ID in Anaplan:
id is the ID that you need to upload the file.
name is the filename of the file.
chunkCount is the number of chunks in the file.
delimiter is double-quotes for columns and fields. For example, "Versions","Opportunities"," "Version 1","Opportunity 0001".
encoding determines the way in which bytes in a file map to Unicode character code points. See Common Character Encodings on Wikipedia.
firstDataRow is the first row after the row containing column names.
format is text, as opposed to a binary stream.
headerRow is the row that contains column names.
separator is the token that separates fields. This is typically a comma, for example, "Versions","Opportunities"," "Version 1","Opportunity 0001".

}

Set the Chunk Count
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/files/{fileId}
To upload a file, we recommend setting the chunkcount metadata of an upload so that the server knows how many chunks to process during an upload. Set the chunkcount to -1 if you do not know how many chunks there will be and will be marking the upload complete when all chunks have been uploaded. If you want to upload the file in a single chunk, see Upload file as a single chunk.
Use chunking:
If you want to be able to resume the transfer after the connection is lost during an upload.
If you are extracting data from a database and want to push it to the server without holding all the results in memory.
To avoid consuming large amounts of memory on the server, a chunk is expected to be between 1 and 50 MB. The chunk count might change if the file to upload has become larger or smaller than the server's version of that file:
id is the ID of the file for which the chunk count is to be updated.
name is the filename of the file.
chunkCount is the number of chunks in the file.
delimiter is double-quotes for columns and fields. For example, "Versions","Opportunities"," "Version 1","Opportunity 0001".
encoding determines the way in which bytes in a file map to Unicode character code points. See Common Character Encodings on Wikipedia.
firstDataRow is the first row after the row containing column names.
format is text, as opposed to a binary stream.
headerRow is the row that contains column names.
separator is the token that separates fields. This is typically a comma, for example, "Versions","Opportunities"," "Version 1","Opportunity 0001".

Upload file as a single chunk
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/files/{fileId} --upload-file Tests.txt
You can upload a single file to the server.
Note: You cannot compress a file that you are uploading as a single file. If the file is smaller than 1 MB, we recommend you PUT it onto the server by streaming it as an octet stream.
Upload a single chunk

Headers
Authorization:AnaplanAuthToken {anaplan_auth_token}
Content-Type:application/octet-stream
Parameters
Response 204

Upload a file in chunks
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/files/{fileId}/chunks/{chunkId} -X --upload-file chunk-aa
Use chunking:
If you want to be able to resume the transfer after the connection is lost during an upload.
If you are extracting data from a database and want to push it to the server without holding all the results in memory.
You can split a file into a set of chunks using a shell command such as split in shell with this syntax: split -b [number of bytes] [path and filename] [prefix for output files] For example: split -b 15360 ArchivedOpportunities.csv chunk-
The first chunk might represent the entire file, or the file might consist of multiple chunks. If the file is larger than 1 megabyte, PUT it onto the server by streaming each "chunk" as an octet stream. To do this, specify the header Content-Type:application/octet-stream.
We recommend that you specify a chunk size no larger than 50MB of uncompressed data with no more than 1,000 chunks per file. To reduce the upload time for larger chunks, compress the chunks. You can compress the chunks in a folder using a shell command. For example, this command compresses all files within the current folder and those below it if they do not have the file extension .gz:
find . -type f ! -name '*.gz' -exec gzip "{}" \;
If you have compressed your chunk files, specify the header Content-Type:application/x-gzip instead of Content-Type:application/octet-stream. This compresses each chunk with the gzip format.

Import Actions

View the following endpoints for further details on import actions APIs:
Get the import Id
Start the import
Get a list of the import tasks
Monitor the import tasks
Check dump file for failures
Download dump file chunks
Get the metadata for an import definition
Completion failure and data error/warning codes

You can bring data into Anaplan by importing it with the API. For instance, you can import a file that you have uploaded.
To import your data using the API:
Upload files.
Get the import id and Start the import.
Monitor each import task using the id that was returned when you started the import. If you are importing a large file, it might take some time depending on the way in which you import it.
Check for failures in each import task when the import is complete.
Note: Workspace administrators can run any action regardless of their assigned model role. For example, if you are a Workspace Administrator, an import ignores any Selective access and Dynamic Cell Access restrictions, in the same way as the desktop experience.
When an import action completes successfully, all downstream calculations are also complete. This includes cells linked by formulas to the cells being updated.
Getting the import id
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/imports/
To run an import, you need its id. You can skip this step if you already know the import id.

}
]
}

Start the import
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/imports/{importId}/tasks/
You start the import using the POST command. This also receives the task ID value as a JSON object. Once you have started the import, you can use GET to receive a list of the import tasks as a JSON array. You can use this to monitor the status of the import tasks.
Note: If GET does not return any tasks, the import is not running or might have completed. Tasks sort in ascending order of creation time, with the newest task at the top of the list. To sort in descending order, append ?sort =- creationTime to the URL.

Monitor the import tasks
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/imports/{importId}/tasks/{taskId}
Get the status of an import task
Use this endpoint to get the status of an ongoing import task.
Notes:
As a best practice, we recommend you check the status of an ongoing import action no more than once every 5 seconds. For long running imports it is suggested to check at even longer intervals.
You can cancel an ongoing monitoring task if you make the same call using the DELETE verb instead of the GET one.
In the response:
currentStep is the task associated with the specified taskID.
taskState is the status that import task.
progress is a double that is typically 1.0.
result is a JSON object that indicates whether a failure dump file was created, the object ID, and whether the task succeeded.
taskID is the ID that you specified in the request.
Here is a list of each possible taskState:
If failures occur during the import task:
details contains a JSON array that contains debug information
If a dump file is available, failureDumpAvailable is true and objectId contains the ID of the dump file. The dump file contains details of the failures that occurred during the import. You can use the objectId to get the dump file.

Check dump file for failures
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/imports/{importId}/tasks/{taskId}/dump
If data could not be imported for an import task, a 'dump' file is created depending on the failure. This contains details of the failures that occurred. Use this information to fix the problems and then try the import again.
Note: To prevent timeouts on large files, download the dump file in chunks. It is possible to download dump files without chunking, but it is strongly recommended that chunking is used instead.
Query the number of chunks in a dump file.
Download the chunks sequentially.
Concatenate the chunks on your host.
Dump files are:
Removed 48 hours after the last access of the file or the next time an import task successfully executes with no errors.
Maintained on a user-by-user basis and overwritten when the user performs the same import.
When an import task has errors, the API maintains a dump file for the task ID with the error.  Any earlier task IDs are erased, though failureDumpAvailable can be True for those task IDs.  If a dump file is removed or replaced, then attempting to download the dump file via the API results in a 404 (Not found) HTTP status.
If you use /tasks?sort=-creationDate in the URL, it is possible for tasks created by other users to appear first for which the dump file is unavailable to the accessing user.  It is also possible that a task that the accessing user ran, and for which a dump file is still available, to be further down on the same list.
Note: The taskID is the last task of the user who carried out the specified import.
Query the number of chunks in a dump file
Begin by querying the number of chunks using the /chunks endpoint.
It is possible for a dump file to be very large. To help manage the size of a dump file and prevent timeouts, download the dump file in chunks. Chunks are 10mb or less and numbered sequentially from 0.

Download Files for Actions

View the following endpoints for further details on download files for actions APIs:
Get the list of export files
Get the chunks in a file
Get the data in a chunk
Delete files

You can download files that were uploaded or download files after carrying out an export.
Get the list of export files
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/files
file list
This gets a list of both the import and export files for a model. You can identify an export file by its metadata and id. Export files have fewer metadata properties and the start of the first part of their ID is different to that of an import file:
id is the file id.
name is the file name.
chunkCount is the number of chunks in the file.
firstDataRow is the first row after the row containing column names.
headerRow is the row that contains column names.

Delete Actions

View the following endpoints for further details on delete actions APIs:
List the actions in the model as a JSON array
Start deletion
Monitor the deletion tasks

You can use this API to automate the the removal of specific items from a list using the 'Delete from List Using Selection' functionality in Anaplan.
Tip: To use this functionality, an appropriate 'Delete from list Using Selection' action must exist in the model that you want to delete from a list. You can create a control module to select the items to be deleted from the list and then create a 'Delete from List using Selection' action. See Delete from List using Selection for further information.
To carry out a delete operation using the API:
Verify that the delete action is available.
Run the delete action.
Get a list of deletion tasks and monitor each deletion task.
List the actions in the model as a JSON array
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/actions
This lists the delete actions available for the given model ID. This returns a JSON array containing the list of delete actions that you can carry out:
id is the Id of the action that you can carry out in the specified model.
name is the name of the action that you can carry out. You can view these actions in the Anaplan user interface in the Action settings for the model.

A Process is a single container that enables several actions to run in a particular order. Processes can be configured on the Anaplan user interface by an Administrator user. A process can contain any combination of import, export, and deletion actions. To run an API-driven process:
List the process definitions available to your model.
Run a process.
Get a list of tasks in a the process definition and monitor each process task.
Check for failures in each process task when the process is complete.
List the process definitions available in a model as a JSON array

}
]

Retrieve metadata for a process
/models/{modelId}/processes/{processId}
Use this call to retrieve the names and actions for a given Process in an Anaplan model.
Notes:
Actions which are imports or exports (actionType field is IMPORT or EXPORT) contain additional fields in the response (see below). Other actions just contain the id, name, and actionType.
Actions are ordered in the sequence that they run when the Process itself is executed.
For an action with actionType of IMPORT, you can use the importDataSourceId value as the ID of a file for the fileId parameter when you upload or download files
For actions with actionType of EXPORT or IMPORT, you can find more information about them if you use the IDs as exportId or importId in the export and import metadata endpoints.
The possible values for actionType (non-exhaustive list):
IMPORT
EXPORT
DELETE_BY_SELECTION
ORDER_HIERARCHY
OPTIMIZER
To include additional information regarding the import data source in an import action, add the ?showImportDataSource=true query parameter to the request.

Monitor the process tasks
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/processes/{processId}/tasks/{taskId}
Get the status of a process task
Use this endpoint to get the status of a specific export task.
You can use optional query parameter includeProcessDetails to get the start time and duration of each step.
Note: As a best practice, we recommend you check the status of an ongoing process no more than once every 5 seconds. For long running processes it is suggested to check at even longer intervals.
In the response:
currentStep is the task associated with the specified taskId.
taskState is the status of the process task.
progress is a double that is typically 1.0.
result is a JSON object that indicates whether a failure dump file was created, the objectId, and whether the task succeeded.
failureDumpAvailable indicates whether this process container or an action within it has a failure dump file. Note: For a deletion action, failureDumpAvailable is always false.
nestedResults indicates whether the actions carried out in the process were successful. This contains details in the form of a JSON array, which also contains some debug information when failures occur. Get the failure dump file to view the complete debug information.
objectID is the identifier of the process task or a task that it includes. For instance, if nestedResults has failureDumpAvailable true, you need the objectID within that section to obtain the related 'dump' file.
taskID is the ID that you specified in the request.
duration is the overall processing time.
startTime is the time when the step started.
Here is a list of each possible taskState:

Check dump file for failures
/workspaces/{workspaceId}/models/{modelId}/processes/{processId}/tasks/{taskId}/dumps/{objectId}
If failures occur during import actions in a process, dump files are created for each failed import action. This contains details of the failures that occurred. Use this information to fix the problems and then try the process again.
To prevent timeouts on large files, download the dump file in chunks.
It is possible to download dump files without chunking, but it is strongly recommended that chunking is used instead.
1. Query the number of chunks in a dump file.
2. Download the chunks sequentially.
3. Concatenate the chunks on your host.
Note: The taskID is the last task of the user who carried out the specified task.
Query the number of chunks in a dump file
Begin by querying the number of chunks using the /chunks endpoint. It is possible for a dump file to be very large. To help manage the size of a dump file and prevent timeouts, download the dump file in chunks. Chunks are 10mb or less and numbered sequentially from 0. In order to get the dump file for a particular action in the process, use the ObjectID. The ObjectID can be obtained from the /tasks/{taskId} endpoint.

| Parameter | Path parameter | Path parameter type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| workspaces | {workspaceId} | string | Returns the IDs of, and information about, workspaces. Use the {workspaceId} path parameter to specify a single workspace.
You can also use these parameters in other calls to specify a workspace for the call to apply to.
Please note that {workspaceId} strings are case-sensitive and should be submitted in lowercase, for example 8a8b8c8d8e8f8g8i. |
| models | {modelId} | string | Returns the IDs of, and information about, models. Use the {modelId} path parameter to specify a single model.
You can also use these parameters in other calls to specify a model for the call to apply to.
Please note that {modelId} strings are case-sensitive and should be submitted in uppercase, for example FC12345678912343455667. |
| imports | {importId} | number | Returns the IDs of, and information about, imports. Use the {importId} path parameter to specify a single import.
You can also use these parameters in other calls (typically including the tasks parameter) to specify an import. A failed import generates a dump file. |
| exports | {exportId} | number | Returns the IDs of, and information about, exports. Use the {exportId} path parameter to specify a single export.
You can also use these parameters in other calls (typically including the tasks parameter) to specify an export. |
| files | {fileId} | number | Returns the IDs of, and information about, files. Use the {fileId} path parameter to specify a single file.
You can also use these parameters in other calls to specify a file, often for an action, such as to delete or upload a file. |
| chunks | {chunkId} | string | Sets the number of, or interacts with, chunks in a file that you import or export.
Splitting a file into chunks enables you to continue an action from an intermediate point if it fails and you have to start again. We recommend that you set an import chunk size of between 1 MB and 50 MB. The default size is 10 MB, although the final chunk is smaller. |
| processes | {processId} | number | Returns the IDs of, and information about, processes. Use the {processId} path parameter to specify a single process. You can also use these parameters in other calls (typically including the tasks parameter) to specify an process.
A process can contain both imports and exports, which means it can result in a dump file generated through a failed import. |
| actions | {actionId} | number | Returns the IDs of, and information about, actions. |
| task | {taskId} | string | Returns the IDs of, and information about, tasks. A task is used, and a {taskId} generated, when you carry out an action such as an import, an export, a process, or a delete. The {taskId} is removed when the model is unloaded. For instance, a model is unloaded when all users log out.
A given task, such as an import action, might have two different IDs if you run the action again before the first {taskID} is removed from the server. |
| dumps | {objectId} | number | Returns the dump file, which contains information about failed imports.
The dump file contains a copy of each row that failed, along with a message about the failure. A file within the dump can have one or more chunks. Only an import can result in a dump file. |
| user | {userId} | string | Returns information about the authenticated user or other users in the workspace. This can be useful if you require user provisioning for the Salesforce.com Anaplan tab. |
| pages | {pageNo} | number | Specifies which pages of a read request to download. The {pageNo} path parameter specifies which page to start the download from. |
| readRequests | {requestId} | number | Initiates a read request for a large volume read of data. Use the {requestId} path parameter to specify a read request to perform an action with, such retrieving its status or deleting it. |


| Query parameter | Possible values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tenantDetails | true, false | A Boolean query parameter. If true, the call response includes the estimated size of a workspace in bytes. |
| includeAll | true, false | A Boolean query parameter. If true, the call response includes additional information about the applicable line item or list. |
| action | add, delete | You can use this to add or delete list items in a call. |
| showImportDataSource | true, false | A Boolean query parameter. If true, the call response includes the ID and format of the import data source. |
| includesubsidiaryviews | true, false | A Boolean query parameter. If true, the call response includes subsidiary views. |
| format | v1 | You can use this to return a JSON response instead of a CSV response when you retrieve cell data for a view. |
| modelDetails | true, false | A Boolean query parameter. If true, the call response includes additional information about a model such as memory usage, creation date, and recent changes. |
| pages | {dimensionId}, {itemId} | You can use this to specify which pages, or list items used as dimensions, to return cell data for. |
